# coding_sprint_2021_12

A [workflowr][] project.

This coding sprint uses data sourced from [kaggle][https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney]. These data have individual rows for movies found on various streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+). Each row contains the title, rating information, genre, and which service it is available to watch on.
